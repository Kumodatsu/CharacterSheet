Plans for upcoming changes are documented in this file.

[ ] Decouple character sheets from characters, allowing one to make multiple character sheets on a character and also load them from other characters.
[X] Make a more contained structure for the character sheet, similar to the stat block.
[X] Remove the ability to have multiple pets and instead allow one to simply activate and deactive the pet UI.
[ ] Add an option to set the pet attack attribute in the UI.
[ ] Add an option for out of combat heal rolls to the UI.
[ ] Set up communication between addon users so that addon data can be exchanged robustly.
[ ] Add a UI frame that displays party/raid members with the addon and their character sheets.
[ ] Add options for keeping track of and managing numbers and texts for event hosts.
[ ] Add an option to add temporary custom bars to the stats frame, for event-specific resources such as Insanity.
[ ] Add a UI frame for altering settings.
[ ] Do not display (raid) messages for unmodified rolls.
[ ] Add character sheet health bar to nameplates of other people who have the addon.
[ ] Allow health to go down to the knocked out limit (-5) instead of 0.
